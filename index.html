            <h1>Ribeirao Preto</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Ribeirão Preto</strong> (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁibejˈɾɐ̃w ˈpɾetu]) is a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Brazil>">municipality</a>
                and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area">metropolitan area </a> located in the
                northeastern region of São Paulo state, Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ribeirão Preto is the eighth-largest municipality in the State with 650.9 km2 (251.3 sq mi). It has an
                estimated population of 711,825 in 2020
                and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area">metropolitan area </a> of 1,178,910. It
                is located 313 km (194 mi) from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo">city of São
                    Paulo</a> and 706 km (439 mi) from <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasilia</a>
                the federal capital. Its mean altitude is 526.8 m (1,728 ft) high. The city's average temperature
                throughout the year is 23 °C (73 °F), and the original predominant vegetation is the Atlantic forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city was originated around 1856 as an agricultural region. Coffee was a primary income source until
                1929 when it lost value compared with the industrial sector.
                In the second half of the 20th century, investment in health, <a

                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass">bioenergy</a>, and information technology led to the
                city being declared a Technological Center in 2010. These activities have caused the city to have the
                30th biggest gross national (GNP) in Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city is also an important cultural center. The Prefeito Luiz Roberto Jábali Park, the Maurilio Biagi
                Park, Carlos Raya Park, Santa Tereza Reserve, and the Zoo are important preservation areas. Pinguim
                Beerhouse, Dom Pedro Theatre, and projects such as Ribeirão
                Preto's Cinema Center are relevant sightseeing points, along with events such as the Agrishow
                Agricultural Fair, Tanabata Festival, Joao Rock Music Festival, and the National Outdoor Book Fair.

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The municipality was founded June 19, 1856, being populated initially by farmers and African slaves
                coming from other areas of São Paulo (especially from Mogi Mirim and São Simão) and Minas Gerais looking
                for land with good pastures. The city was built by a stream called Black Creek, and was named after it
                (Ribeirão Preto means black creek in Portuguese, sometimes translated as "Black Stream"). The fertile
                soil of Ribeirão Preto region allowed a high crop productivity.

            </table>

            <p>
                Initially the main rural activities were pastures, cattle and subsistence agriculture. In the 1870s, the
                coffee crop arrived to Ribeirão Preto. The rapid development of coffee cultivation brought wealth and
                progress to the city, which by the 1880s had become the largest coffee producer in the world. Coffee,
                also called "green gold," caused a "gold rush" in the region, which attracted workers and adventurous
                people from many parts of the world. This movement was helped by the new Mogiana Railway, linking
                Ribeirão Preto to São Paulo and to the port city of Santos, and by the abolition of slavery in Brazil,
                in 1888. The end of slavery created a strong market for labor, and "coffee barons", as coffee farmers
                were called, also stimulated immigration. Immigrants coming from Europe (mostly Italy, but also from
                Portugal, Spain and Germany) and from Japan have settled in coffee farms of Ribeirão Preto and
                neighboring towns. Some of the immigrants, especially the Italians, were settled at the "Núcleo Colonial
                Antonio Prado" (Antonio Prado Colonial Nucleus) which was created by the government in 1897. This
                nucleus originated many of the northern and eastern districts of Ribeirão Preto. Later, after the stock
                market crash of 1929, some of the immigrants bought the farms from their impoverished former employers.

            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>
                Adding to the Native Amerindians already living in the area when migrants began to occupy and settle the
                land, the population of Ribeirão Preto includes, amongst other groups, descendants of Africans,
                Italians, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Germans, Lebanese immigrants who were attracted to the region,
                after the abolition of slavery in 1888, when immigrants were granted lands, after being indentured
                workers. Descendants of enslaved African people constitute a big and important element of the
                population. Italians also arrived in huge number.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the 1990s, Northeastern migrants came to the region attracted by São Paulo state cities' economic
                development, which was widely broadcast in TV documentaries. With the city's super population by
                individuals who often had no technical skills and were often illiterate, poverty and crime grew
                considerably. Many migrants boosted the economy by working in sugar cane plantations and orange groves,
                though. However, those who perform seasonal duties often have no safety net when the work is over. IBGE
                estimative (2020) indicates that Ribeirão Preto has a population of 711,825 inhabitants. The urban
                agglomeration incorporates 34 municipalities, with a population of about 1.4 million inhabitants.

            <p>At the beginning of the 20th century and during its first three decades, Ribeirão Preto was a rich city,
                boasting several mansions, European-style cafés, cabarets and even two opera houses, as result of the
                coffee economy. One of the opera houses – the Carlos Gomes Theatre (in honour of Brazilian opera
                composer Carlos Gomes) – was demolished in 1949, but the other – the "Pedro II Theatre" (named in honor
                of Emperor Dom Pedro II), dating from the 1920s – resisted time and was restored and modernized during
                the 1990s. Its ceiling, completely destroyed in a fire of 1980, was rebuilt and gained a new design
                projected by Japanese-Brazilian artist Tomie Ohtake. The Pedro II Theatre is now the third largest opera
                house in Brazil and is the home of the Ribeirão Preto symphony orchestra, one of the oldest and most
                important in Brazil.</p>
            <p>Several events take place in Ribeirão Preto, many of which occur annually, such as the Agrishow (an
                international fair of agricultural technology), Fair Photo Image, Film Festival Ribeirão Preto, National
                Book Fair of Ribeirão Preto, Festival Tanabata (Japanese cultural festival), Festitália (Italian
                cultural festival), João Rock Music Fest, Ribeirão Rodeo Music, Bonfim Paulista Rodeo Show, Ribeirão
                Skol Folia, Fair ExpoHair, Feitrans (Fair Transport Interior Paulista), Arena Cross, Entorta Bixo,
                Ribeirão Cana Invest, Expobonsai, AVIRRP, Comida di Buteco, Restaurant Week Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão
                Preto Tropeada, Mitsubishi Rally Cup, Copa Chevrolet Montana, and others. These events move various
                segments of the municipality, as the airport, bus system, taxi, hotel chain, bars, restaurants, and
                more.</p>
            <p>An important fact for the city life happened in 1911 with the opening of its first big factory, the
                Antarctica Brewery Company, nowadays part of the AmBev group. Antarctica built the Pedro II Theatre. The
                Antarctica factory led to the opening of several beer houses in the city and one of them named Pinguim
                (penguin in Portuguese), became particularly famous and made Ribeirão Preto nationally renowned for the
                quality of its draft beer (chope or chopp in Brazilian Portuguese). Many people say that Pinguim has the
                best draft beer in Brazil and it became so important that it is now a symbol of the city; people say
                that coming to Ribeirão Preto and not visiting Pinguim is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope.
                There are two Pinguim beer houses in Ribeirão Preto: one of them is at the Quarteirão Paulista (Paulista
                Square), next to November XV square in central area of Ribeirão Preto and right beside the Pedro II
                Theatre. The other one is at the mall Ribeirão Shopping. The Pinguim beer house was named after the
                Antarctica company's logo (see at [1]). Many small "alambiques" exist in the region, each producing its
                own singular "Pinga," better known as Cachaça. These "Pingas" are often aged and are available in many
                flavours, while still maintaining their flair.</p>
            <p>Pinguim is not the only good beer house in Ribeirão Preto. The municipality has a hot climate, which
                makes people go out in the evening to chat and enjoy cold draft beers in bars. Therefore, the
                municipality is teeming with bars, from the simple "botequins" or "botecos" that one can find in almost
                every corner, to the most sophisticated pub style bars, which rival their counterparts in São Paulo and
                Rio de Janeiro. Ribeirão Preto has also many micro-breweries, many of them nationally known.</p>
            <p>Ribeirão Preto is considered one of the major centers of business tourism in the country, being chosen by
                the Ministry of Tourism as an inducer of regional tourism development, between 4 cities of São Paulo and
                64 other locations throughout Brazil. Currently the city has 52 hotels in full operation, with 8600 beds
                (or jobs), beyond 30 motels with 2000 beds, beds totaling 10,600 rooms in the network of the city.</p>

                <p>Ribeirão Preto is the birthplace of one of the oldest samba schools in       Brazil: the "Bambas" founded
                    in 1927. However, as a string carnival, becoming samba schools later. Besides this pioneering
                    school, there are the Embaixadores dos Campos Elíseos (Ambassadors of Campos Elíseos), Tradição do
                    Ipiranga (Tradition of Ipiranga), Camisa 12 Corintiana (12 Corinthian Shirt) and Imperadores do
                    Samba (Emperors of Samba). In Bonfim Paulista district, two samba schools are present: Acadêmicos de
                    Bonfim and Unidos da Vila.

            <p>The municipality possesses two soccer stadiums, the Estádio Palma Travassos (of Comercial FC) and Santa
                Cruz (of Botafogo FC). Botafogo FC is currently competing in Campeonato Brasileiro Série C and
                Campeonato Paulista, whereas Comercial FC is currently competing in Campeonato Paulista Série A3. On the
                national and international scene, Botafogo is often confused with the Rio de Janeiro club with the same
                name to the extent that the Rio club is often credited with being the infamous club against which Pelé
                scored a record 8 goals in one game. One example is in Franklin Foer's book "How Soccer Explains the
                World". But it was in the Paulista championships on November 21, 1964, in the coastal city of Santos and
                against the Ribeirão Preto's team that Pelé achieved the incredible feat and his Santos team won by an
                11 × 0 score. The 8 goals were payback for the defeat Santos suffered on September 6, 1964, when they
                visited Ribeirão Preto during the first round of the tournament and lost 2 x 0. Not only had a "small"
                team beaten one of the "big" teams, but had done so while insulting the "King". A better claim to fame
                for Botafogo (often referred to as Botafogo-SP) is that Brazilian soccer captains (and brothers)
                Sócrates and Raí started their careers with Botafogo.<br>

                In 2017 a men's volleyball team was founded in Ribeirão Preto, Vôlei Ribeirão, which was champion of

                Brazil, from 2019-2021. The matches of Vôlei Ribeirão took place at Cava do Bosque, a public sports
                centre in Ribeirão Preto. The volleyball team ended in 2021.

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>After the New York Stock Exchange crash of 1929 the economy of Ribeirão Preto, based on a single export
                crop, collapsed, and the city had to adapt to a new situation. Since the city is relatively far from
                other major Brazilian urban centers, it found a new economic vocation in the services and commercial
                sector, which was developed to attend the local and regional demands.[citation needed]
                <br>
                The second economic boom in the history of Ribeirão Preto occurred after the oil crisis (1973 and 1979)
                of the 1970s. The increase in the oil price obliged Brazil to look for alternative means of fueling and
                the solution found was the alcohol fuel program, or Pro-Álcool as it is called. Pró-Álcool led to the
                development of a technology which allows the use of ethanol (sugarcane alcohol) either as automotive
                fuel or as a gasoline additive. The latter improves performance and substitutes lead thus decreasing
                polluting emissions. Due to the Pró-Álcool program, farmers from the region of Ribeirão Preto were
                encouraged by government subsidies to grow sugarcane. The high productivity of the land around Ribeirão
                Preto rapidly placed the region as the largest alcohol and sugar producer of the world, being
                responsible for 30 percent of Brazil's sugarcane alcohol fuel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sugarcane boom brought a new age of prosperity for the city, which was called the "Brazilian
                California" during the 1980s and early 1990s. On the one hand, this has increased the city's wealth and
                turned it into a sophisticated centre of services for Brazil and South America but, on the other hand,
                the image of a new "Eldorado" attracted many migrants from impoverished areas of Brazil leading to a
                rapid population growth and the appearance of slums (favelas as they are called in Brazil).[7] <br>

                Nowadays, the sugarcane is the major crop produced in the rural area of the municipality, followed by
                minor crops such as pastures, maize, peanut and soybean. Ribeirão Preto's major manufactures are:
                medical materials, dental materials, animal feed, meat, dairy products, textiles, steel, furniture,
                building materials, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and, of course, beer. The city hosts "Agrishow" on an
                annual basis, this show is one of the most important agricultural trade shows in Brazil.[citation

                    Monte Alegre Farm, an important coffee farm from the Schmidt family of German immigrants, and
                    transformed it into an agricultural practical school. Several new buildings and houses for the
                    professors were constructed on a land which held before tens of thousands of coffee plants. The new
                    school was very well planned and urbanized and many trees were planted to provide shadow and give it
                    a pleasant atmosphere. But the agricultural school never achieved a significant development and it
                    was closed in 1951. A longstanding dream of the population of Ribeirão Preto was to have a
                    university and in 1952 the old farm was donated to the University of São Paulo for the creation of a
                    medical school, which was the first school of its campus at Ribeirão Preto.
                    <br>
                    Fortunately, many original buildings of the agricultural school and even some of the Monte Alegre
                    Farm were preserved and only adapted to hold the new university, which makes its campus one of the
                    most beautiful university campuses in Brazil. After the creation of the medical school the
                    University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto (USP-RP) has been growing steadily and it is presently
                    constituted by eight schools: School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto (FMRP), School of Law of Ribeirão
                    Preto (FDRP), School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (FFCLRP), School of Dentistry (FORP),
                    School of Economics, Administration and Accounting (FEARP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences
                    (FCFRP), School of Nursing (EERP) and School of Music (DMRP-ECA).
                    <br>
                    The creation of USP-RP stimulated the cultural and academic life in Ribeirão Preto and several
                    schools, colleges and universities were opened in the city since then. The municipality has also
                    many private colleges such as: Centro Universitário Barão da Mauá, Centro Universitário Moura
                    Lacerda, Centro Universitário Estácio, Faculdade Anhanguera, Faculdade Reges, Faculdade São Luís,
                    Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP), Universidade Paulista (UNIP), Universidade de Ribeirão
                    Preto (UNAERP).
                    <br>
                    One interesting fact is that in Ribeirão Preto there is one Local Cometee of AIESEC. Present in over
                    110 countries and territories and with over 60,000 members, AIESEC is the world's largest
                    student-run organisation. Focused on providing a platform for youth leadership development, AIESEC
                    offers young people the opportunity to be global citizens, to change the world, and to get
                    experience and skills that matter today. Their office is in Rua das Paineiras, casa 9, USP, Monte
                    Alegre.

                <h3>Science and Technology</h3>
                <p>Despite Ribeirão Preto, the entire region comprehends one of the principal University and Research
                    Centers of the State, highlighting the health, engineering and high technology in São Carlos,
                    agronomics, vet and zoo in Jaboticabal, zoo and food engineering at Pirassununga, among others.
                    Therefore, the region consolidates itself as an important technological and educational polo. In May
                    2012 was opened the School of Technological Training (FORTEC) "Jandyra Camargo Moquenco" downtown,
                    beginning its activities with four classes and attending around 900 students, divided in three
                    shifts.
                    <br>
                    Ribeirão Preto's Technology Park has as its objective to support the scientific and technological
                    development of the area, attracting companies that invest in research and development of products,
                    focused in the areas of health and biotechnology, that prioritize sustainable development. The focus
                    is to the Education and Research institutions, that comprehends the development of human resources,
                    the availability of technological services and competence, and the technological demands from the
                    companies in the area of Ribeirão Preto and from Brazil itself altogether with the international and
                    national's technological trends in the Health and Biotechnology industry. Ribeirão Preto's
                    Technology Park counts with equipment that induces research and development, as the Medical and
                    Hospital Equipment Laboratory, a Business Center and a Business Incubator. The city also is an
                    educational center in IT. In 2005 the city counted already with more than 300 companies in the
                    activity and in 2010 the area had an increase of 23% in the income of the companies in the industry
                    of Information and Communication Technology. Other areas that the city also stands out in the
                    technological sector are the Health, the Biotechnology and the Bioenergy, considered one of the
                    biggest sugar and ethanol's producers worldwide.

                <h3>Railroad</h3>
                <p>Currently the city's railway system is not functional. There are some projects underway to revitalize
                    it.[13]

                    The first railway to arrive in Ribeirão Preto belonged to the Mogiana Company of Railroads, and the
                    railway station was inaugurated on November 23, 1883. In 1970 it became part of the Railroad
                    Paulista SA, and continued to operate until 1976 when the railroad tracks were transferred. On June
                    1, 1966, was inaugurated the new railway station, now owned by Centro- Atlantic (FCA), which
                    received passengers until August 1997, when these trains were suppressed. In addition to these
                    Ribeirão Preto has been served by two other railroads. The Dumont Railway, built by Mogiana,
                    connecting the city to the farm Dumont, owned by Henrique Santos Dumont, at west of the city, and
                    the train station Dumont, who belonged to the railroad, was inaugurated in 1890 and abandoned by the
                    closure of the line in 1940, and demolished in March 1968. The Railroad São Paulo-Minas transported
                    ore between Ribeirão Preto and Minas Gerais, with the station that was inaugurated on May 1, 1928,
                    and operated until around 1970.</p>
